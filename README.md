This repository documents my learning journey in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack during my summer PEP classes.

## About the Project
In this project, I explore the core concepts and practical applications of the MERN stack by building various features and mini-projects. The repository is structured to reflect my progress, from foundational learning to more advanced topics, highlighting key challenges, solutions, and takeaways.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB: For database operations and handling data storage.
- Express.js: To set up the backend and handle server-side logic.
- React.js: To create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Node.js: For server-side scripting and building a scalable backend.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository and navigate through the different folders to explore my progress and learnings.

## Future Scope
   - Expanding the project to include more advanced MERN topics such as authentication, authorization, and deployment.
   - Exploring other full-stack technologies to complement my MERN knowledge.
